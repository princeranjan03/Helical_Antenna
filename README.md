# Antenna & Wave Propagation Assignment
**Course Code: ECPC-307**

## Aim
The aim of this assignment is to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the calculation in the Friis Transmission Equation using given parameters, implemented in Python.

## Overview
The assignment focuses on creating a Python-based GUI to facilitate the calculation process based on the Friis Transmission Equation. This equation describes the power transfer between two antennas in free space. The Python GUI will provide an efficient and interactive tool for students and researchers studying antenna and wave propagation.

## Components of the Python GUI
1. **Input Parameters:**
   - Frequency of operation (in Hertz)
   - Transmitting antenna gain (in dB)
   - Receiving antenna gain (in dB)
   - Distance between antennas (in meters)
   - System losses (in dB)

2. **Calculation Button:**
   - Implement a button to initiate the calculation based on the entered parameters.

3. **Output Display:**
   - Display the calculated Received Power on Reciever side using the Friis Transmission Equation.
   - A simple animation depicting the Friis transmission equation

## Python GUI Usage Instructions
Follow these steps to use the Python GUI effectively:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the Python script for the GUI.
3. Enter the required parameters in the designated input fields.
